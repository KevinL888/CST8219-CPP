# CST8219-C++
Learn C++ building on the concepts of memory management and object-oriented programming studied in other languages in previous courses. Used as a language of choice for highly efficient application development particularly on the Windows platform, the C++ language expands the C paradigm to include encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. In addition, standard libraries, such as the Standard Template Library is introduced as ready-made frameworks for application development.

# RasterGraphic Project
•	RasterGraphic is a console application which consist of GraphicElements in a forward list from the STL(Standard Template Library).\
•	Each GraphicElement has a vector of  Image pointers that are either a GPU Memory Image or System Memory Image address.\
•	Implemented virtual functions to ensure that any Image in the vector will call the correct overridden polymorphic function.\
•	Used ostream overloaded friend function to display the data in each Image.
